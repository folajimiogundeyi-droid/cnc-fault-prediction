# CNC Machine Fault Prediction

This project is a machine learning–based web application developed to predict faults in CNC machines.

The system uses a Random Forest classifier trained on CNC operational data such as:
- Spindle speed
- Vibration
- Tool temperature
- Motor current
- Feed rate
- Tool wear

The application is built with Python and deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input machine parameters and receive real-time fault predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How It Works
1. The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets
2. A Random Forest model is trained
3. Model accuracy and feature importance are displayed
4. Users can input machine parameters to predict faults
